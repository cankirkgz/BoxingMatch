<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Create two fighters with custom names, damage, health, weight, and dodge attributes.</li>
  <li>Simulate a boxing match between the fighters.</li>
  <li>Determine the winner based on their health at the end of the match.</li>
  <li>Check if the fighters meet the weight requirements before the match.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>

<p>To get started with the boxing match simulator, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Clone the repository:</li>
  
  <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/your-username/boxing-match-simulator.git</code></pre>
  
  <li>Open the project in your Java IDE.</li>
  <li>Locate the <code>Main.java</code> file and run it.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>

<p>Once the program is running, it will simulate a boxing match between two fighters. The match is played in rounds, and each fighter takes turns hitting their opponent. The health of each fighter decreases based on the damage inflicted by the opponent. The match continues until one of the fighters' health reaches zero.</p>

<p>The fighters' attributes such as name, damage, health, weight, and dodge can be customized in the <code>Main.java</code> file. Adjust these attributes to create different matchups and test different scenarios.</p>
